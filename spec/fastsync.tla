-------------------------------- MODULE fastsync --------------------------------
(*
 A specification of the fast sync finite-state machine that is introduced in:
 
 https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/ancaz/blockchain_reactor_reorg/docs/spec/reactors/block_sync/bcv1/impl-v1.md
 
 We are modeling three important ingredients:
    - a non-faulty FSM that does fast sync
    - a block pool that maintains the blocks that FSM receives from the peers, and
    - the reactor, which may be completely chaotic.
    
 This specification focuses on the events that are received and produced by the FSM from the reactor.

 Constants that are introduced for model checking purposes.
 In the future, we may want to introduce them as CONSTANTS.

  Q1. What if a faulty peer is reporting a very large height? The protocol is stuck forever?
  
  Q2. Can we ever collect over maxNumRequests (=64) blocks.
      It seems to be an upper bound on the pool height. See pool.go:194
      
  Q3. I do not see why pool.makeRequestBatch cannot produce duplicate heights in pool.plannedRequests.
  
  Q4. Why don't you clean up pool.plannedRequests in pool.go:180?
