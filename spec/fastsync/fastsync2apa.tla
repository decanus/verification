-------------------------------- MODULE fastsync2apa --------------------------
(*
 This is a version of fastsync that can be processed by APALACHE.
 That is, it contains necessary type annotations and small fixes
 in expressions like a..b.
 
 A specification of the fast sync finite-state machine that is introduced in:
 
 https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/ancaz/blockchain_reactor_reorg/docs/spec/reactors/block_sync/bcv1/impl-v1.md
 
 We are modeling three important ingredients:
    - a non-faulty FSM that does fast sync
    - a block pool that maintains the blocks that FSM receives from the peers, and
    - two reactors: a chaotic one and one which does some checks as in the implementation
    
 This specification focuses on the events that are received and produced by the FSM from the reactor.
 Importantly, we do not specify neither communication between the FSM and the peers,
 nor communication between the reactor and the peers.
 
 Version 2. Modeling only one global timeout called OnGlobalTimeoutTicker, we need fairness and eventually for that.
 Version 1 used state timeouts that pose additional challenges in showing non-trivial termination.

\* Finally, this is how a transition by FSM looks like
NextFSM ==
    \/ InInit
    \/ InWaitForPeer
    \/ InWaitForBlock
    \/ InFinished

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* The system is the composition of the non-deterministic reactor and the FSM                      *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)
Init == turn = "FSM" /\ InitReactor /\ InitFSM

FlipTurn == turn' = (IF turn = "FSM" THEN "Reactor" ELSE "FSM") 

Next == \* FSM and Reactor alternate their steps (synchronous composition introduces more states)
    /\ FlipTurn

        THEN /\ NextFSM

        ELSE /\ NextReactor
             /\ outEvent' = NoEvent <: OET
             /\ UNCHANGED <<state, blockPool>>  

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* Expected properties *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)
\* a few simple properties that trigger counterexamples
NeverFinishAtMax == [] (state = "finished" => blockPool.height < blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

\* always finish at maximum height (we exclude timeouts that trivially violate the property)
AlwaysFinishAtMax ==
   ([] (inEvent.type /= "stopFSMEv"))
     => [] (state = "finished" => blockPool.height = blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

\* always finish at the height below or equal to the maximum height (timeouts excluded)
NeverFinishAbovePeerHeight ==
   ([] (inEvent.type /= "stopFSMEv"))
    => [] (state = "finished" => (blockPool.height <= blockPool.maxPeerHeight))

\* This seems to be the safety requirement:
\*   all blocks up to poolHeight have been processed 
Safety == HRange(0, blockPool.height - 1) \subseteq blockPool.processedHeights

\* before specifying liveness, we have to write constraints on the reactor events
\* a good event
NoFailuresAndTimeouts ==
    \* no peer removal
    /\ inEvent.type /= "peerRemoveEv"
    \* no invalid blocks
    /\ inEvent.type = "blockResponseEv" => inEvent.block.valid
    /\ inEvent.type = "processedBlockEv" => ~inEvent.err
    
\* the reactor can always kill progress by sending updates or useless messages
FiniteResponse ==
    <>[] (inEvent.type
         \notin { "statusResponseEv", "blockResponseEv", "processedBlockEv", "makeRequestsEv"})

\* the protocol always has an option to terminate just by issuing timeout         
NoGlobalTimeout == inEvent.type /= "stopFSMEv"

\* This is a termination property we would naively write.
\* However, it is invalid, as there is no guarantee on that any useful event will ever trigger.
NaiveTermination == <>(state = "finished" /\ blockPool.height >= blockPool.maxPeerHeight)
    
\* A liveness property that tells us that the protocol should terminate in the very good case.
\* WF_turn(FlipTurn) makes sure that FSM and Reactor keep alternating their steps.
GoodTermination ==
  (WF_turn(FlipTurn) /\ []NoGlobalTimeout /\ []NoFailuresAndTimeouts /\ FiniteResponse)
     => <>(state = "finished" /\ blockPool.height >= blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

\* This property is violated as a peer can send statusResponse, never provide the block,
\* and then reconnect again.
\* A counterexample works also for the case when an atacker keeps producing peers.
FalseTermination ==
  (WF_turn(FlipTurn) /\ SF_<<inEvent>>(OnSendBlockRequestTicker))
     => <>(state = "finished")

\* TougherTermination is the termination property we like more and it holds true.

\* When IncreaseHeight holds true, fastsync is progressing, unless it has hit the ceiling.
IncreaseHeight ==
    blockPool'.height > blockPool.height \/ blockPool'.height >= ultimateHeight

TougherTermination ==
  (blockPool.height < ultimateHeight
    /\ (WF_turn(FlipTurn)
        /\ SF_inEvent(OnSendBlockRequestTicker)
        /\ (([]<> (<<IncreaseHeight>>_blockPool)) \/ <>(inEvent.type = "stopFSMEv"))
     )) \***
       => <>(state = "finished")

\* One more property for the case when we start at ultimateHeight.
\* In this case, if the FSM is not receiving any further status updates from the peers,
\* it cannot process a block at the maximum height.
\* Thus, the protocol can only terminate by timeout.
NoPeerUpdatesInWaitForBlock ==
    state = "waitForBlock"
      => inEvent.type \notin { "statusResponseEv", "peerRemoveEv" }

CornerCaseNonTermination ==
    (/\ blockPool.height = ultimateHeight
     /\ []NoGlobalTimeout
     /\ []NoPeerUpdatesInWaitForBlock)
    => [](state /= "finished")
