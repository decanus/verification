A (high-level) protocol specification of the fast sync finite-state machine
after the implementation that is introduced in:
 
 https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/ancaz/blockchain_reactor_reorg/docs/spec/reactors/block_sync/bcv1/impl-v1.md

This specification does not go into the details of the implementation. Rather,
its aim is to capture the implemented finite-state machine and its interaction
with the environment, which is modelled as Reactor.
