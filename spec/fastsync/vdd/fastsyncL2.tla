----------------------------- MODULE fastsyncL2 -----------------------------
(*
 L2 specification of the fast sync protocol.
 
 In this specification, we have two parties:
    - the node (state machine) that is doing fastsync
    - the peersState (the peers with which node interacts to download blocks)

We assume a system in which one node is trying to sync with the blockchain 
(replicated state machine) by downloading blocks and executing transactions 
(part of the block) agaings the application, and the set of full nodes 
(we call them peers) that are block providers.

Peers can be faulty, and we don't make any assumption about rate of correct/faulty nodes in the
node peerset (i.e., they can all be faulty). Processes (client and peers) communicate
by message passing. They exchange the following messages:

- StatusRequest
- StatusReply
- BlockRequest
- BlockReply
 
Correct peers are part of the replicated state machine, i.e., they manage
blockchain and execute transactions against the same deterministic application A.
We assume Tendermint failure model, i.e., given a trusted header h, we assume that >2/3 of voting power will behave
correctly until time h.Time + TRUSTED_PERIOD. We don't make any assumptions about behavior of faulty processes.

In this spec we assume a simpler problem (compared to complete fast-sync) defined with the following assumptions: 

- node is initialised with a set of peers with which messages can be exchanged
- peers can be removed (in case they misbehave) but they cannot be added
- some numbers of peers is faulty (correct and faulty peer ids are input parameter)
- peers do not modify its height, i.e., we take a snaphsot of the system and try to sync as much as we can
within that shapshot; therefore StatusRequest message is sent only once
- we assume synchronous communication between correct processes (node and correct peers) and model communication
with asycnhronous rpc calls, i.e, every request receives corresponding reply 
- faulty processes can send arbitrary messages (even if they are not requested)
- fast sync should terminate with at least a block height that is equal to the maximum height of the correct peer

This spec can be extended allong the following lines to capture full fast sync problem:

1) Node can establish connections to other peers during fast sync protocol. This should probably be modelled by having
additional input message received by Node (AddPeer). This should be relatively easily supported
as it shouldn't significantly affect termination conditions. More preciselly, the properties should be very similar 
in case we bound eventually reception of AddPeer messages; otherwise we can't terminate as AddPeer message can 
always delay termination.

2) Peers modify its height (blockchain grows) and node wants to try to sync to the latest block. In this case, node
needs to send multiple StatusRequest messages. We might want to try to model this variant as multi-round version of this
spec where round corresponds to a single loop (StatusRequest sent -> All corresponding StatusResponses received -> Termination 
condition satisfied). In this case starting next round could be modelled as an external event (NextRound). 
Termination condition would then be constrained of eventually stopping to receive NextRound events.

\* if there is at least single correct process in peerSet, then blockPool.height >= maxCorrect - 1

\* Termination condition
Termination == state = "finished" =>
