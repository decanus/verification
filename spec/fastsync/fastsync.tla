-------------------------------- MODULE fastsync --------------------------------
(*
 A specification of the fast sync finite-state machine that is introduced in:
 
 https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/ancaz/blockchain_reactor_reorg/docs/spec/reactors/block_sync/bcv1/impl-v1.md
 
 We are modeling three important ingredients:
    - a non-faulty FSM that does fast sync
    - a block pool that maintains the blocks that FSM receives from the peers, and
    - two reactors: a chaotic one and one which does some checks as in the implementation
    
 This specification focuses on the events that are received and produced by the FSM from the reactor.
 Importantly, we do not specify neither communication between the FSM and the peers,
 nor communication between the reactor and the peers.

\* a sample property that triggers a counterexample in TLC
NeverFinishAtMax == [] (state = "finished" => blockPool.height < blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

\* always finish at maximum height (we exclude timeouts that trivially violate the property)
AlwaysFinishAtMax ==
   ([] (inEvent.type \notin {"stopFSMEv", "stateTimeoutEv"}))
     => [] (state = "finished" => blockPool.height = blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

\* always finish at the height below or equal to the maximum height (timeouts excluded)
NeverFinishAbovePeerHeight ==
   ([] (inEvent.type \notin {"stopFSMEv", "stateTimeoutEv"}))
    => [] (state = "finished" => (blockPool.height <= blockPool.maxPeerHeight))

\* This seems to be the safety requirement:
\*   all blocks up to poolHeight have been processed 
Safety == 0..blockPool.height - 1 \subseteq blockPool.ghostProcessedHeights

\* before specifying liveness, we have to write constraints on the reactor events
\* a good event
NoFailuresAndTimeouts ==
    \* no timeouts, no peer removal
    /\ inEvent.type \notin { "stateTimeoutEv", "peerRemoveEv" }
    \* no invalid blocks
    /\ inEvent.type = "blockResponseEv" => inEvent.block.valid
    /\ inEvent.type = "processedBlockEv" => ~inEvent.err
    
\* the reactor can always kill progress by sending updates or useless messages
FiniteResponse ==
    <>[] (inEvent.type
         \notin { "statusResponseEv", "startFSMEv", "stopFSMEv", "blockResponseEv",
                  "processedBlockEv", "makeRequestsEv"})
    
\* A liveness property that tells us that the protocol should terminate in the good case.
\* (This property holds but it seems to be quite restrictive.)
\* WF_turn(FlipTurn) makes sure that FSM and Reactor keep alternating.
GoodTermination ==
  (WF_turn(FlipTurn) /\ []NoFailuresAndTimeouts /\ FiniteResponse)
     => <>(state = "finished" /\ blockPool.height = blockPool.maxPeerHeight)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)
(* Questions in the back of my head *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

(*
  Q1. What if a faulty peer is reporting a very large height? The protocol is stuck forever?
  
  Q2. I do not see why pool.makeRequestBatch cannot produce duplicate heights in pool.plannedRequests.
  
  Q3. Why don't you clean up pool.plannedRequests in pool.go:180?
