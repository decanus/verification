This is a sequential specification of a blockchain. There is neither consensus
algorithm in it, nor there is any distributed computation. We only describe how
a tendermint blockchain evolve in a very abstract way. The non-trivial part
here is the relation between the validators, their voting power, and the
commiters of the previous block.

This specification was prepared in one day in Novi Sad, so do not expect much
from it.
